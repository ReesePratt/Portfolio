                        <p>
                            This was one of my first ever C++ games!!!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I remember first being given the assignment to make Pacman, and regrettably I thought this was an easy game to recreate… I was wrong. <br> 
                            This project gave me a great insight to how 2D games are created as this was my first glimpse into one, it also gave me great knowledge in C++, 2D Collisions, and Artificial Intelligence.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="major">Creation Process</h3>
                        <p>
                            With this being one of my first ever games, it gave me a great insight to Games Programming, and throughout the development of it; I enjoyed it greatly. <br>
                            Never the less, this game was developed for ~3 Months; adding features as well as polishing the code to make it as perfect as possible. Every week I would add a feature <br>
                            and then try to make it work with as little code as possible; whistle still making it work correctly. <br>
                            To Summarise, this project was a great task to complete for my University Course and will continue to love Games Programming in general.
                        </p>
